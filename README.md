This is the source for my website. The styling is done with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and uses [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) as well as [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/). The fonts are [Gauge Regular by Daniel Pimley](http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/gauge), and [Pacifico from Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Pacifico). There is a small bit of Javascript that is used to deobfuscate data so it's not scraped. (I know that's a bit silly, but I thought, why not). The SVG icons came from [http://iconmonstr.com/](http://iconmonstr.com/). (Their markup is inlined in the page so the color can be set by CSS).

There's not much to it, but I tried lots of versions of every element of the page. Fonts, colors, animations, gradients, all of it.
