This is the source for my website. The styling is done with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and uses [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) as well as [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/). The fonts are [Gauge Regular by Daniel Pimley](http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/gauge), and [Pacifico from Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Pacifico). The SVG icons came from [http://iconmonstr.com/](http://iconmonstr.com/). (Their markup is inlined in the page so the color can be set by CSS).

There's not much to it, but I tried lots of versions of every element of the page. Fonts, colors, animations, gradients, all of it.

About me
================

I'm a full-stack software developer in Portland, Oregon. I do a lot of front-end work and enjoy using Javascript and Sass very much. I also use Python and Django a lot. I used to do a lot of work with C#, which is also very nice but unfortunately limited in important ways.

I have been privileged to work in many different areas of application development over my career - developing a webapp product from scratch and supporting it, desktop Windows apps, content management systems, services to do involved things like calculating returns on a portfolio, APIs, integrating devices like fingerprint scanners and credit card machines (the kind with the pretty color screens), integrating with financial institutions, build infrastructure and platforms for developers, and more. 

Some areas I have not explored as much include distributed systems and mobile apps, though I am familiar with Cocoa and Objective-C.
